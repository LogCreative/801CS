## Objective

- This program is a micro system based on batch files, which is editable without any compilation. This **SoB** (System on Batch) method is a glimpse of my two other systems (DSS, FS).
- This program shows **how batch files interate with each other** by using condition statements only and giving commands through commandline.
- This program shows three machenism for a system based on batch: **check,backup and uninstall**. A good practice for file manipulation.
- This program uses an external program **image.exe** to **show images on terminals**.

## Compilation

- This system is modified to run on any directories. (originally only on E:\\)
- This system is modified to pop up error dialogs if you input wrong command.
- The commandline could accept CAPTION COMMANDS now.
- The data is censored for public release.
